- full-duplex communication:
    - 2-way communication
    - Can be triggered by the server as well as the client.

- WebSocket protocol is different from HTTP.
- WebSocket protocol allows full-duplex communication.
- HTTP allows only one way communication ie can be triggered only from the client.

- We will use Socket.io library to build our app.

- socketIOServer.on()
    - Its basically attaching an event listner to an event
    - on(<name of the event>, ()=>{
        function that runs when this event occurs
    })

- Some events -
    1. connection
        - Fired when a client connects to our Socket.io configured server.

- Client Side Code -
    - Socket.io provides us code that can be used to connect to our server from a client. (check index.html)

- Event Listner can be added using socket.on() and an event can be emitted using socket.emit().

- Broadcasting an event - yaha pe ek event emit karte for all the clients except the one on the current socket.
- Eg. say a new user has joined our chat room, then we can Broadcast a message saying that a "new user has joined" to everyone except the current new user.

- for broadcasting -> socket.broadcast.emit()
- sirf current socket ke client ke pass bhejna he -> socket.emit()
- sare clients ke pass bhejna he -> io.emit()

- Event Acknowledgement: sender gets notified that the reciever has recieved the message/data.
- Step 1 - socket.emit() ka last argument -> a function -> runs on the sender when the message has been recieved by the reciever.
- Step 2 - a last argument to the event listner on the reciever is the function we supplied to emit(), we can call it "callback".
